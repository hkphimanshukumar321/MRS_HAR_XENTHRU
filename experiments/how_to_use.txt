How to Use These Modules
Logging Training Progress:
In your training script, import the logger:

python
Copy
from training_logger import TrainingLogger
logger = TrainingLogger()
# Inside your epoch loop:
logger.log_epoch(epoch=1, train_loss=0.345, train_accuracy=0.78, val_loss=0.412, val_accuracy=0.75)
Saving Models and Metrics:
In your training/evaluation script, import the saver functions:

python
Copy
from experiment_saver import save_model, save_metrics

# After training:
save_model(model, framework="tensorflow", save_name="har_model_v1")

# After evaluation:
metrics = {"accuracy": 0.93, "confusion_matrix": [[50, 5], [3, 42]]}
save_metrics(metrics, file_name="evaluation_metrics.json")
These two modules encapsulate all experiment tracking (logging and saving) functionality in a simple, easy-to-use manner. You can extend them further as your project evolves.
