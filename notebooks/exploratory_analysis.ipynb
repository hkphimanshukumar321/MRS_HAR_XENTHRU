""" Purpose: The Jupyter Notebook exploratory_analysis.ipynb is provided for offline data exploration and initial experimentation. In the early stage of the project, use this notebook to understand the dataset and verify preprocessing and modeling assumptions. What it contains:
Data Visualization: Code to load samples of the raw radar data and visualize them. For example, plotting a single frame (range vs amplitude image) or a sequence of frames over time (perhaps as a video or a heatmap over time).
Statistical Analysis: Computation of basic stats like distribution of activities, number of samples per subject, etc. This ensures class balance or identifies if some activities or subjects have more data than others.
Preprocessing Demo: Applying the preprocessing steps (background subtraction, normalization) to a sample and visualizing the effect. Perhaps plotting the raw vs background-subtracted signal.
Feature Exploration: If relevant, computing some domain-specific features (like total energy, radar cross-section estimates, etc.) to see if they differentiate activities.
Initial Modeling Attempts: Possibly training a simple model on a subset of data within the notebook (e.g., a small CNN or even an SVM on features) to gauge the problem difficulty. This could include trying different window sizes for sequences or visualizing how a pre-trained network sees the data.
Usage:
Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
bash
Copy
jupyter notebook notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb
and run through the cells. This requires having the appropriate Python environment with needed libraries (numpy, matplotlib, etc.). This notebook is not essential for running the pipeline but is extremely useful for understanding and presenting the project. Note: Since this is a Markdown output, we won’t display the content of the notebook here, but in your project repository, that notebook would contain code and markdown commentary. Ensure to add descriptive markdown in the notebook explaining each step and observation, and include charts (e.g., using matplotlib or seaborn) to visualize data patterns. For instance, you might include a plot of a radar signal heatmap for a walking vs a falling activity to show differences. Future Notebook Work: You can create additional notebooks for hyperparameter tuning experiments, model comparisons, or analyzing the cross-validation results (like visualizing confusion matrices for each subject’s fold). Storing such exploratory work in notebooks keeps the main codebase clean but allows you to document the reasoning and findings."""
